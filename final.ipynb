This source stood out for a few reasons:\n","- ACS data is collected on a far more granular level than any other source to my knowledge\n","- The ACS tracks data points that overlapped exceptionally well with potential poverty factors I was interested in examining\n","- Data was readily available via public API, leaving no concerns about accessibility or integrity beyond my own ability to utilize those resources\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8FJ6vf03VQ28"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Armed with a clear direction, my next step was to actually gather the data! The Census API offers [multiple options](https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs.html) with respect to the ACS; the 'detailed tables' endpoint, containing the information of interest, includes both 1-year and 5-year breakouts. These represent a tradeoff between recency and specificity; I ultimately chose to use the 5-year breakout so that I could drill down to the ['block' level, which is the smallest geographical unit that the Census provides](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2011/07/what-are-census-blocks.html).\n","\n","I initially entered this investigation planning to use ZIP codes; however, the [lack of defined boundaries](https://proximityone.com/tracts_zips.htm#:~:text=Census%20tracts%20are%20polygons%20and,points%20not%20even%20one%20line) and reduced dataset observations led me away from this approach.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RFOqDU6uWKiD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To retain modularity and save time, especially while fine-tuning my models, I opted to split Census data grabs out into a separate ACS_Data_Grab.py file.

For instance, a count of individuals receiving food stamps, SNAP, or public assistance is a product of poverty without practical predictive value from a policy-making perspective. Similarly, data points involving employment, salary, etc. are not useful model inputs for my purposes.\n","\n","I settled on a few major categories:\n","- Total population (used for calculations, not as a formula input)\n","- Individuals below the poverty level (my pre-transformed target variable)\n","- Counts of individuals in granular age brackets, split by gender (I combine these for a gender-agnostic view)\n","- Count of individuals with hispanic ethnicity\n","- Count of individuals by race\n","- Count of individuals by their method of transportation to work\n","- Count of individuals by educational attainment\n","- Count of available housing units\n","- The median year in which buildings were constructed\n","- Count of individuals by veteran status\n","- Count of individuals by their home language being English alone\n","- Count of individuals by travel time to work (60-89 and 90+ categories are combined for one 60+ category)\n","- State code (a crude attempt to account for location-based discrepancies in the absence of an innately geographic model)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"liTN9-cdgL5b"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["I converted most variables to reflect percentages of the total population, standardizing interpretation over different blocks with different population sizes.
